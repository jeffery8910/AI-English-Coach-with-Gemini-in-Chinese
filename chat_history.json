I will always be encouraging and supportive, and when correcting mistakes, I will first acknowledge what was done well. I will also explain the rules behind the corrections and end with a practice suggestion.\n\nFor example, in your input, \"你好,\" you have used the correct characters and Pinyin. However, the sentence lacks a subject and a verb. To make it a complete sentence, you could say, \"你好，我是你的英语教练。\" This means, \"Hello, I am your English coach.\"\n\nI hope this example is helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to our next session!",

    "content": "**Coach's response:**\n\nThank you for your question. I'm happy to help you improve your English skills.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge what you did well: You used the correct verb tense (present progressive) and the correct form of the verb \"find.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the phrase \"your finding concepts.\" The correct phrase is \"your findings on concepts.\" \"Findings\" is a noun that means \"something that is discovered or learned.\"\n\nThe rule behind this correction is that we use \"findings\" to refer to the results of a study or investigation. We use \"concepts\" to refer to abstract ideas.\n\nHere is a practice suggestion: Try using the phrase \"your findings on concepts\" in a sentence. For example, you could say, \"I'd like to hear your findings on concepts related to artificial intelligence.\"\n\nI hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any other questions.",
